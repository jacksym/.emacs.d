** play
there is no pain you are receding
a distant ship smoke on the horizon
you are only coming through in waves
your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
when I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone,
I cannot put my finger on it now

hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
because a vision softly creeping
left its seeds while I was sleeping
and the vision that was planted in my brain
still remains
within the sound of silence

in restless dreams I walked alone
through narrow streets of cobblestone
'neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
that split the night
and touched the sound of silence

and in the light I saw
ten thousand people maybe more
people talking without speaking
people hearing without listening
people writing songs that voices never share
and no one dared
disturb the sound of silence

fools said I you do not know
silence like the cancer grows
hear my words that I might teach you
take my arms that I might reach you
but my words like silent raindrops fell
and echoed
in the wells of silence

and the people bowed and prayed
to the neon god they made
and the sign flashed its warning
in the words that it was forming
and the sign said, "the words of the prophet are written on the subway walls
and tenement halls"
and whispered in the sound of silence
